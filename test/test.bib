  Abstract	= {Artificial models have been used as interactive partners
		  for decades to study the social behavior of animals. Recent
		  technological developments have opened up novel
		  possibilities by allowing researchers to use remote
		  controlled and autonomous objects in these studies, and
		  Animal-Robot Interaction has become an emerging field of
		  behavior science. However, there are theoretical,
		  methodological and practical issues in ethological research
		  using robotic agents. Here we aimed to provide an overview
		  on robots by classifying them along different aspects to
		  facilitate future research, and to present some novel
		  approaches that could be considered as a guide for
		  researchers who are new to the fields of animal-robot
		  interactions (ARI) and human-robot interactions (HRI). The
		  present review may facilitate future collaboration between
		  biologists/psychologists, robot developers, engineers and
		  programmers that further contributes to the development of
		  novel research methods and procedures.},

  Abstract	= {As the field of social robotics is growing, a consensus
		  has been made on the design and implementation of robotic
		  systems that are capable of adapting based on the user
		  actions. These actions may be based on their emotions,
		  personality or memory of past interactions. Therefore, we
		  believe it is significant to report a review of the past
		  research on the use of adaptive robots that have been
		  utilised in various social environments. In this paper, we
		  present a systematic review on the reported adaptive
		  interactions across a number of domain areas during
		  Human-Robot Interaction and also give future directions
		  that can guide the design of future adaptive social robots.
		  We conjecture that this will help towards achieving
		  long-term applicability of robots in various social
		  domains.},
